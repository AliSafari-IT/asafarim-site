## Internet media type
A **media type** (formerly known as MIME type) is a two-part identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet.<br/>
As an example, an HTML file might be designated `text/html`; `charset=UTF-8`. In this example, <em>text</em> is the <b>type</b>, <em>html</em> is the <b>subtype</b>, and charset=UTF-8 is an optional <b>parameter</b> indicating the character encoding.
