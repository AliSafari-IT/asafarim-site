<br />

More precisely, people can ***perceive, understand, navigate, as well as interact with the Web*** and ***contribute to the Web***. <br/>
 Web accessibility includes all disabilities that affect access to the Web, comprising:

- auditory
- cognitive
- neurological
- physical
- speech
- visual
  
Accessibility is essential (for a web app), hence removing barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world can make the web, our products and services accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.
