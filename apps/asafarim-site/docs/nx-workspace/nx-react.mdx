# Nx and React

Nx is a smart and extensible build framework to help you develop, test, build, and scale with React and React frameworks like Gatsby, Next.js, Docusaurus, ... and React Native.

## Create a React Workspace with Nx
By running the following command in your Terminal or Command prompt:
```bash title="Create nx workspace"
npx create-nx-workspace --preset=react
```
### Create a React application
```bash title="Create react app: this command creates a new React app named todos"
nx generate application todos
```
Running the generate command above will add two projects to your workspace:

- A React application
- E2E tests for the React application

### Serve application
Now that the application is set up, you can run it locally via:
```bash
npx nx serve todos
```
----
## Add React capabilities to an existing Nx workspace
If you have already an existing Nx workspace that was not preset with React or it is an empty workspace, then you can add React capability (the React core plugin) to the workspace by running the command below :
```bash
yarn add @nrwl/react
```
### Generate a React application
```bash title="Command to create a React app called frontend"
nx g @nrwl/react:app frontend
```
The *frontend* project is a full React app scaffolded with `main.tsx`, an *entrypoint* file:

```tsx title="apps>frontend>src>main.tsx"
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

import App from './app/app';

ReactDOM.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

By the way, if you look in the `frontend-e2e` folder, youâ€™ll see the *Cypress* project with the traditional structure of any **Cypress test suite**:
