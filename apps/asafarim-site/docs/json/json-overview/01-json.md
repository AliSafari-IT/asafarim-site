## Introduction

JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays. It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, one example being web applications that communicate with a server.<br/>
A JSON string can be stored in its own file, which is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a [MIME type](/docs/content-type-mime) of application/json.

## Who Invented JSON?
