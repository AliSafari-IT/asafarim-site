## Why wireframing?

Perhaps an effective way to learn issues early on before any implementation is wireframing of your design processes. 
A wireframe gives information on the location of elements on the page, how contents are prioritized, what functionalities are available,
 and how users will interact with the site. Also, how web pages are inter-connected with each other.

<Box>
<img style={{margin:'10px auto', width: '95%'}} 
src="/img/wireframe.svg" 
alt="A sample wireframe " />
</Box>
