# Learning TypeScript
TypeScript enhances discipline in JavaScript programming perhaps at the cost of flexibility that JavaScript owns. With TypeScript you can uncover errors in your code before you execute it, and leverage productivity enhancements like variable and property renaming. Regardless of types, annotations, interfaces, and classes TypeScript can be easily added to your workflow.

TypeScript is an open-source language, though it is controlled by Microsoft, but as a superset of JavaScript, not only does it support all of JavaScript's features, but also adds some of its own to it.

Big companies and successful tech companies that often have high standards, have reason to use the best technology available such as TypeScript to reap more money out of the market, giving more  credibility to this programming language. In large projects with multiple developers refactoring by applying latest knowledge reveals the advantage of TypeScript compared to Javascript.

However, at the end TypeScript compiler strips out all of type information and gives you normal JavaScript code that effectively can be recognized by any browser.
