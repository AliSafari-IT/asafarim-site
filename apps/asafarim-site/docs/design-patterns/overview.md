## Catalog of design patterns

The catalog of Gang-of-Four (the same refernce as mentioned above) classifies the design patterns as follows:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Creational patterns</th>   <th>Structural patterns</th>   <th>Behavioral patterns</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Increase flexibility and reuse of existing code by providing various object creation mechanism</td>  
<td>Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.</td>   
<td>These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</td>   
</tr>
</table>
