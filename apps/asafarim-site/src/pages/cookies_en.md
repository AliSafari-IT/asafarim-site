# Cookies policy

## What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site.

- First party cookies are cookies set by the website you’re visiting. Only that website can read them. In addition, a website might potentially use external services, which also set their own cookies, known as third-party cookies.
- Persistent cookies are cookies saved on your computer and that are not deleted automatically when you quit your browser, unlike a session cookie, which is deleted when you quit your browser.
Every time you visit the Asafarim’s website, you will be prompted to accept cookies upon further browsing. 

The purpose is to enable the site to remember your preferences (such as dark-mode, language, etc.) for a certain period of time.

That way, you don’t have to re-enter them when browsing around the site during the same visit.

Cookies can also be used to establish anonymised statistics about the browsing experience on our sites.

## How do we use cookies?
Asafarim’s website mostly might use “first-party cookies”. These are cookies set and controlled by the website, not by any external organisation.

However, to view some of our pages, maybe you will have to accept cookies from external organisations.  

The 2 types of first-party cookie we use are to:
- gather analytics data (about user behaviour)
- Visitor preferences

These are set by us and only we can read them. They remember:

* if you have agreed to (or refused) this site’s cookie policy
* if you have already replied to our survey pop-up (about how helpful the site content was) – so you won't be asked again

## Third-party cookies
Some of our pages display content from external providers, e.g. YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. To view this third-party content, you first have to accept their specific terms and conditions. This includes their cookie policies, which we have no control over.

These third-party services are outside of the control of the Asafarim website. Providers may, at any time, change their terms of service, purpose and use of cookies, etc.

## Removing cookies from your device

You can delete all cookies that are already on your device by clearing the browsing history of your browser. This will remove all cookies from all websites you have visited.

Be aware though that you may also lose some saved information (e.g. site preferences).
